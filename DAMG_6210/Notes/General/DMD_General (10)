You have two tables, pricing and discounts. Common link between these tables is product_code which can have null value in both the tables. A null product_code record in pricing table is considered a match with discounts table record with NULL product_code value. Which query can perform a correct inner join on all the records including NULL records?

SELECT * from pricing p JOIN discounts d ON IFNULL(p.product_code, 1) = IFNULL(d.product_code,1)
